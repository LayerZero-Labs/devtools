 *      abi.encode(target, callValue, refundReceiver, callData)
 * where:
 *      - target: address to call (must not be address(0))
 *      - callValue: uint128 amount of ETH to forward (if any)
 *      - refundReceiver: address to which any leftover tokens will be refunded
 *      - callData: arbitrary calldata to execute on the target.
 *
 * In addition, we use OFTComposeMsgCodec to extract:
 *      - srcSender: the original sender on the source chain.
 *      - amount: the token amount delivered from the OFT.
