# Setup and Deployment for EVM and Move-VM OFT Adapters

## EVM OFT Adapter Setup and Deployment

- In your `hardhat.config.ts` file, add the following configuration to the network you want to deploy the OFTAdapter to:
  ```typescript
  // Replace `0x0` with the address of the ERC20 token you want to adapt to the OFT functionality.
  oftAdapter: {
      tokenAddress: '0x0',
  }
  ```

### Developing Contracts

###$ Installing dependencies

We recommend using `pnpm` as a package manager (but you can of course use a package manager of your choice):

```bash
pnpm install
```

#### Compiling your contracts

This project supports both `hardhat` and `forge` compilation. By default, the `compile` command will execute both:

```bash
pnpm compile
```

If you prefer one over the other, you can use the tooling-specific commands:

```bash
pnpm compile:forge
pnpm compile:hardhat
```

Or adjust the `package.json` to for example remove `forge` build:

```diff
- "compile": "$npm_execpath run compile:forge && $npm_execpath run compile:hardhat",
- "compile:forge": "forge build",
- "compile:hardhat": "hardhat compile",
+ "compile": "hardhat compile"
```

#### Running tests

Similarly to the contract compilation, we support both `hardhat` and `forge` tests. By default, the `test` command will execute both:

```bash
pnpm test
```

If you prefer one over the other, you can use the tooling-specific commands:

```bash
pnpm test:forge
pnpm test:hardhat
```

Or adjust the `package.json` to for example remove `hardhat` tests:

```diff
- "test": "$npm_execpath test:forge && $npm_execpath test:hardhat",
- "test:forge": "forge test",
- "test:hardhat": "$npm_execpath hardhat test"
+ "test": "forge test"
```

### Deploying Contracts

Set up deployer wallet/account:

- Rename `.env.example` -> `.env`
- Choose your preferred means of setting up your deployer wallet/account:

```
MNEMONIC="test test test test test test test test test test test junk"
or...
PRIVATE_KEY="0xabc...def"
```

- Fund this address with the corresponding chain's native tokens you want to deploy to.

To deploy your contracts to your desired blockchains, run the following command in your project's folder:

```bash
npx hardhat lz:deploy
```

More information about available CLI arguments can be found using the `--help` flag:

```bash
npx hardhat lz:deploy --help
```

By following these steps, you can focus more on creating innovative omnichain solutions and less on the complexities of cross-chain communication.

## Move-VM OFT Adapter Setup and Deployment

### connecting to aptos via cli

To install aptos cli, run the following command:

```
brew install aptos
```

If you need to generate a new key, run the following command:

```
aptos key generate --output-file my_key.pub
```

Then initialize the aptos cli and connect to the aptos network:

```
aptos init --network=testnet --private-key=<your-private-key>
```
 
You can then verify that your initialization was successful by running the following command:

```
cat .aptos/config.yaml
```

If successful the config will be populated with the RPC links and your account private key, account address, and network.

Note: Your private key is stored in the .aptos/config.yaml file and will be extracted from there.

## Setup

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```bash
ACCOUNT_ADDRESS=<your-aptos-account-address>
EVM_PRIVATE_KEY=<your-evm-private-key>
```

Then run `source .env` in order for your values to be mapped to `$ACCOUNT_ADDRESS` and `$EVM_PRIVATE_KEY`

Note: aptos account address can be found in .aptos/config.yaml

## Build and deploy aptos move modules

Note: to overwrite previous deploy and build, you can use `--force-build true` for the build script and `--force-deploy true` for the deploy script.

### Build the modules

```bash
pnpm run lz:sdk:move:build --oapp-config move.layerzero.config.ts --named-addresses oft=$ACCOUNT_ADDRESS,oft_admin=$ACCOUNT_ADDRESS
```

### Deploy the modules

First modify deploy-move/OFTAdpaterInitParams.ts and replace the oftMetadata with your desired values:

```ts
const oftMetadata = {
  move_vm_fa_address: "0x0",
  shared_decimals: 6,
};
```

```bash
pnpm run lz:sdk:move:deploy --oapp-config move.layerzero.config.ts --named-addresses oft=$ACCOUNT_ADDRESS,oft_admin=$ACCOUNT_ADDRESS --move-deploy-script deploy-move/OFTAdapterInitParams.ts
```

## EVM Deployment

```bash
npx hardhat lz:deploy
```

Select only the evm networks (DO NOT SELECT APTOS or MOVEMENT)

## Init and Set Delegate

Before running the wire command, first inside of move.layerzero.config.ts, set the delegate address to your account address.

```ts
    contracts: [
        {
            contract: bscContract,
            config: {
                owner: 'YOUR_EVM_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS',
                delegate: 'YOUR_EVM_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS',
            },
        },
        {
            contract: aptosContract,
            config: {
                delegate: 'YOUR_APTOS_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS',
                owner: 'YOUR_APTOS_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS',
            },
        },
    ],
```

Then run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run lz:sdk:move:init-fa-adapter --oapp-config move.layerzero.config.ts --move-deploy-script deploy-move/OFTAdapterInitParams.ts
```

```bash
pnpm run lz:sdk:move:set-delegate --oapp-config move.layerzero.config.ts
```

## Wire

> **Important:** Follow the [LayerZero Project Configuration Guide](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/create-lz-oapp/project-config) to properly set up your `layerzero.config.ts` file with correct endpoint IDs and network configurations before running wiring commands.

For EVM:r
Ensure that in move.layerzero.config.ts, all of your evm contracts have the owner and delegate contract is specified.

```ts
    contracts: [
        {
            contract: your_contract_name,
            config: {
                owner: 'YOUR_EVM_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS',
                delegate: 'YOUR_EVM_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS',
            },
        },
        ...
    ]
```

If you are wiring Solana to Move-vm, create a file in deployments/solana-mainnet/MyOFT.json (solana-testnet if you are using testnet) and add the following field:

```json
{
    "address": <oftStore-Address-from-solana-deployment-folder>
}
```

Commands:

```bash
pnpm run lz:sdk:evm:wire --oapp-config move.layerzero.config.ts [--simulate true] [--mnemonic-index 0]
```

--simulate <true> and --mnemonic-index <value> are optional.
--mnemonic-index <value> is the index of the mnemonic to use for the EVM account. If not specified, EVM_PRIVATE_KEY from .env is used. else the mnemonic is used along with the index.

Troubleshooting:
Sometimes the command will fail part way through and need to be run multiple times. Also running running `pkill anvil` to reset the anvil node can help.

For Move-VM:

```bash
pnpm run lz:sdk:move:wire --oapp-config move.layerzero.config.ts
```

## Set Fee

```bash
pnpm run lz:sdk:move:adapter-set-fee --oapp-config move.layerzero.config.ts --fee-bps 1000 --to-eid number
```

## Set Rate Limit

```bash
pnpm run lz:sdk:move:adapter-set-rate-limit --oapp-config move.layerzero.config.ts --rate-limit 10000 --window-seconds 60 --to-eid number
```

Rate limit limits how much is sent netted by the amount that is received. It is set on a per pathway basis.
For example if the rate limit from Aptos to EVM is 100 tokens you can send 100 tokens from Aptos to EVM, however if you receive 50 tokens from EVM to Aptos you are then able to send 150 tokens from Aptos to EVM.
Window is the number of seconds over which the capacity is restored. If the rate limit is 1000 and window is 10 seconds, then each second you get 100 (1000/10) capacity back. The units of the rate limit are the tokens in local decimals.

## Unset Rate Limit

```bash
pnpm run lz:sdk:move:adapter-unset-rate-limit --oapp-config move.layerzero.config.ts --to-eid number
```

## Permanently Disable Blocklist

> ⚠️ **Warning**: This will permanently disable the blocklist for the OFT. It is for OFTs that want to demonstrate to their holders that they will never use blocklisting abilities.

```bash
pnpm run lz:sdk:move:adapter-permanently-disable-blocklist --oapp-config move.layerzero.config.ts
```

### Transferring Ownership of your Move OApp (OFT)

There are three steps to transferring ownership of your Move OFT:

1. Transfer the delegate to the new delegate
2. Transfer the OApp owner of the your to the new owner
3. Transfer the Move-VM object owner to the new owner

To set the delegate, run the following command:
First ensure that the delegate is specified in the move.layerzero.config.ts file.

```ts
    contracts: [
        {
            contract: your_contract_name,
            config: {
                delegate: 'YOUR_DESIRED_DELEGATE_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS',
            },
        },
        ...
    ]
```

Then run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run lz:sdk:move:set-delegate --oapp-config move.layerzero.config.ts
```

To transfer the OApp owner, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run lz:sdk:move:transfer-oapp-owner --oapp-config move.layerzero.config.ts --new-owner <new-owner-address>
```

To transfer the Move-VM object owner, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run lz:sdk:move:transfer-object-owner --oapp-config move.layerzero.config.ts --new-owner <new-owner-address>
```

Note: The object owner has the upgrade authority for the Object.

### Mint to Account on Move VM OFT:

> ⚠️ **Warning**: This mint command is only for testing and experimentation purposes. Do not use in production.
> First add this function to oft/sources/internal_oft/oft_impl.move in order to expose minting functionality to our move sdk script:

```
public entry fun mint(
    admin: &signer,
    recipient: address,
    amount: u64,
) acquires OftImpl {
    assert_admin(address_of(admin));
    primary_fungible_store::mint(&store().mint_ref, recipient, amount);
}
```

Then run the following command to mint the move oft:

```bash
pnpm run lz:sdk:move:mint-to-move-oft --oapp-config move.layerzero.config.ts --amount-ld 1000000000000000000 --to-address <your-move-account-address>
```

## Send Tokens

### Send from Move VM to EVM

```bash
pnpm run lz:sdk:move:send-from-move-oft \
  --oapp-config move.layerzero.config.ts \
  --amount-ld <amount-to-send> \
  --min-amount-ld <minimum-amount-to-receive> \
  --src-address <your-move-account-address> \
  --to-address <destination-evm-address> \
  --gas-limit 400000 \
  --dst-eid <destination-chain-eid>
```

### Send from EVM to Move VM

```bash
pnpm run lz:sdk:evm:send-evm \
  --oapp-config move.layerzero.config.ts \
  --src-eid <source-chain-eid> \
  --dst-eid <destination-chain-eid> \
  --to <destination-move-address> \
  --amount <amount-to-send> \
  --min-amount <minimum-amount-to-receive>
```

## Help

```bash
pnpm run lz:sdk:help
```

Select only the evm networks (DO NOT SELECT APTOS or MOVEMENT)

### Verifying successful ownership transfer of your Move-VM OFT:

Run the following command:

```bash
aptos account list \
  --account <OBJECT_ADDRESS> \
  --url https://fullnode.testnet.aptoslabs.com \
  --query resources
```

Note: replace the url with your desired aptos fullnode url.

Look for the following in the output:

```json
{
  "0x1::object::ObjectCore": {
    ...
    "owner": "0x<OWNER_ADDRESS>",
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```

If the owner is your desired address, then the ownership transfer was successful.

For verifying the admin look for the following in the output:

```json
    {
      "<your-oft-address>::oapp_store::OAppStore": {
        "admin": "0x<ADMIN_ADDRESS>",
        ...
      }
    }
```

If the admin is your desired address, then the ownership transfer was successful.
