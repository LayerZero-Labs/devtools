/// @dev This contract is a composer that allows transfers of ERC20 and HYPE tokens to a target address on hypercore.
///      This contract adds in an ownership model where the owner can recover tokens from the composer on hypercore.
///      This is useful for tokens that are stuck on the composer on hypercore and need to be recovered.
///      The owner can also recover tokens from the composer on hyperevm to the recovery address.
///      The owner can recover native tokens (HYPE) and USDC as well.
///
/// @dev This contract does NOT refund dust to the receiver because we do not expect any due to truncation of sharedDecimals.
///      In the off-chance that you have dust you would have to implement dust refunds to the receiver in:
///      `_transferERC20ToHyperCore` and `_transferNativeToHyperCore`
///
/// @dev Disclaimer: If your token's evm total supply exceeds your asset bridge's balance when scaled to EVM, it is possible
///      that the composer will not be able to send the tokens to the receiver address on hypercore due to bridge consumption.
///      Tokens would instead be returned to the sender address on HyperEVM. Front-end handling is recommended.
