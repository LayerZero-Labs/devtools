# Hyperliquid OFT Implementation

## Architecture diff

Hyperliquid has 2 “chains” - an `EVM` named `HyperEVM` and a "`L1`" called `Hyperliquid`.

The `EVM` has precompiles that let you interact with the `L1`. The `L1` is where all the trading occurs.

## RPC

You interact with the `EVM` via traditional `eth_` rpc calls - full list [here](https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/evm/json-rpc).
The `L1` however takes in a domain specific calls named `L1 actions` or `actions` - full list [here](https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/exchange-endpoint).

## Accounts

On `HyperEVM` and the `L1` you use the same account. You sign transactions (on `HyperEVM`) and actions (on `L1`) with the same private key.

## Dual Block Architecture

There are small blocks that are quicker and with less gas - 2 seconds and 2M gas. (this is the default)

There are big blocks that are slower and with more gas - 60 seconds and 30M gas. (this is where deployments occur)

They are both EVM blocks and you can toggle between them by sending an L1 action of type `evmUserModify`.

```json
{"type": "evmUserModify", "usingBigBlocks": true}
```

You can also use `bigBlockGasPrice` instead of `gasPrice` in your transactions.

Note: This flags the user as using big blocks and all subsequent actions will be sent to the big block chain. You can also toggle this flag on and off.

## Precompiles

Precompiles are what they call "system addresses" and are abundant:
`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` lets you get data about the L1 such as L1 block number.
`0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222` is like a treasury/gateway and should have `non-system EVM spot supply = max native spot supply`.
`0x3333333333333333333333333333333333333333` is to send transaction from EVM to L1.
`0x5555555555555555555555555555555555555555` is the wrapped `HYPE` token.

## Tokens Standards

Tokens on the `EVM` are `ERC20` (EVM Spot) and on L1 are `HIP-1` (Native Spot).
They need to be linked together, which is an irreversible process - described [here](https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/deploying-hip-1-and-hip-2-assets).
If you do not link them, then you can't use the token on L1 - which means no trading and spot. In this case it would be like a normal ERC20.

`ERC20`:`HIP-1` = 1:1

You can also use Hyperliquid's explorer to deploy the token on L1 - [here](https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/deploySpot).

Note : There are no checks to ensure that the balance of the token on the EVM is the same as the balance of the token on L1.

## Linking the ERC20 to the HIP-1

The ERC20 needs to be linked to the HIP-1. Documentation [here](https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/evm/native-transfers).

There are 2 actions that need to be performed:

1. `requestEvmContract` - Populates the intention to link the HIP-1 to the ERC20.
2. `finalizeEvmContract` - usable when an `EOA` sends the transactions to confirm the link.

Now transactions can be send to the `0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222` address to send tokens from the EVM to L1.
L1 to EVM is done via the actions `spotSend` (or the front end)

[This](https://2356094849-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FyUdp569E6w18GdfqlGvJ%2Fuploads%2F4k3MpHVOdp1EBQ7jaUW2%2Ferc20_example.py?alt=media&token=eb96dabe-3de0-425f-a998-5a78bb1f94b9) is an example on how to deploy and link.

## HyperEvm <> L1 Communication

HyperEVM can read state from the L1 via `precompiles` - such as perps positions.
HyperEVM can send state to the L1 through `events` at certain `precompile` addresses.

## Transfers

Spot assets can be sent from EVM to L1 and vice versa. They are called `Native Spot` and `EVM Spot`.
These are done by sending an `ERC20::transfer` with `0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222` as the recipient.

The event emitted is `Transfer(address from, address to, uint256 value)` => `Transfer(_from, 0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222, value);`
And this is picked up by the Hyperliquid team running the backend.

Note: The transaction MUST be sent to the `0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222` address.

## OFT level differences

We can't auto convert all tokens to `native spot` in an `lzReceive` function because users might want to hold the token on `HyperEVM` and only move it to `L1` when they want to trade.

The solution is to have an `lzCompose` function for the `evm spot` and `native spot` conversion on the ingress.
Unfortunately this means that `OFT` developers who already have an `lzCompose` function will need to do some plumbing - chain this `lzCompose` function to their existing one.
Also requires some changes to the security model of the `OFT` contract since the `msg.sender` changes.
[UNAUDITED EXAMPLE THAT CAN BE A POINTER](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/devtools/tree/experimental/hyperliquid_oft_multi_compose/packages/oft-hyperliquid-evm/contracts)
NEVER USE THE CODE IN THE EXAMPLE ABOVE - IT IS UNAUDITED AND NOT TESTED - PROLLY DOESN'T EVEN COMPILE.

`_composeMsg` which is part of the `OFTComposeMsgCodec` (`SendParam.composeMsg`) should contain the `_receiver` address - and it should be encoded as an `abi.encodePacked()` of the `receiver` address.
This is because the `to` address in the transfer is the `OFT` contract address and not the `receiver` address.
The `OFT` contract receives the token minting and then transfers it to the `receiver` address - after which it calls `transferToHyperLiquidL1` to emit the event `Transfer(receiver, 0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222, amount);`.

That particular `Transfer` event is what Hyperliquid L1 nodes/relayers listen to in order to credit the `receiver` address on the L1.

```solidity
struct SendParam {
    uint32 dstEid;
    bytes32 to; // OFT address (so that the OFT can execute the `compose` call)
    uint256 amountLD;
    uint256 minAmountLD;
    bytes extraOptions;
    bytes composeMsg; // token receiver address (msg.sender if you want your address to receive the token)
    bytes oftCmd;
}
```

### HyperLiquidERC20Extended

The `ERC20Extended` contract is a wrapper around the `ERC20` contract that allows for the transfer of tokens to the HyperLiquid L1 contract.
It is a normal ERC20 contract that has a function to transfer tokens to the HyperLiquid L1 contract (`0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222`).

This is required to generate the `Transfer` event that Hyperliquid L1 nodes/relayers listen to in order to credit the `receiver` address on the L1.
Since it exposes an internal function `_transfer`, it needs callers to be approved by the `owner` of the contract. The `owner` is by default the `msg.sender` of the constructor (the deployer of the contract).

The `owner` can approve callers by calling `approveCaller` and remove their approval by calling `removeApprovedCaller`.

The deployed `LZComposer` will need to be approved by the `owner` of the `HyperLiquidERC20Extended` contract for it to be able to call `_transfer` on the `ERC20Extended` contract and generate the `Transfer` event.

```solidity
contract HyperLiquidERC20Extended is ERC20 {
    constructor(string memory name, string memory symbol) ERC20(name, symbol) {}

    function transferToHyperLiquidL1(address _receiver, uint256 _amountLD) external onlyApprovedCallers {
        _transfer(_receiver, 0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222, _amountLD);
    }
    // ...
}
```

### LZComposer

The composer will be a separate contract because we don't want developers to change their OFT contract apart from the import for `HyperLiquidERC20Extended`.

```solidity
contract HyperLiquidLZComposer is IHyperLiquidComposer {
    constructor(address _endpoint, address _oApp) {
        endpoint = _endpoint;
        oApp = _oApp;
    }

    function lzCompose(address _oApp, bytes32 _guid, bytes calldata _message, address _executor, bytes calldata _extraData) external payable override {
        //
    }
}
```

The `LZComposer` will need to be approved by the `owner` of the `HyperLiquidERC20Extended` contract for it to be able to call `_transfer` on the `ERC20Extended` contract and generate the `Transfer` event.

## LZ Transaction

Since this is a compose call - the `toAddress` is the `HyperLiquidLZComposer` contract address.
The token receiver is encoded as an `abi.encodePacked()` of the `receiver` address into `SendParam.composeMsg`. This is later used in the `lzCompose` phase to transfer the tokens to the L1 spot address on behalf of the `token receiver` address.

```solidity
_credit(toAddress, _toLD(_message.amountSD()), _origin.srcEid)
```

which `mints` the amount in local decimals to the token receiver (`HyperLiquidLZComposer` contract address).
We now need to send the tokens to the L1 spot address on behalf of the `token receiver` address.

```solidity
_transfer(_receiver, 0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222, amount);
```

Since the layerzero transaction is not sent by the `token receiver` address, we can't do a `transferFrom()` with `from` as the `token receiver` address.
This is because the `token receiver` can't `approve()` the `OFT` contract address to spend the tokens on a transaction sent by the `executor` of the `lzReceive` function - who isn't the `token receiver`.

We need to do a low level call that changes the token receiver's balance and sends the tokens to the L1 spot address. This emits the `Transfer` event.

This is where `HyperLiquidERC20Extended` comes in.

```solidity
    /// @notice Transfers tokens to the HyperLiquid L1 contract
    /// @dev This function is called by lzCompose()
    /// @dev This function is where tokens are credited to the receiver address
    /// @dev We can always assume that the receiver has the tokens the lzReceive() function will credit them
    function transferToHyperLiquidL1(address _receiver, uint256 _amountLD) external {
        if (!approvedCallers[msg.sender]) {
            revert ERC20Extension_NotApprovedCaller();
        }
        // Transfer the tokens that the composer received during lzReceive() back to the receiver
        _transfer(msg.sender, _receiver, _amountLD);
        // Make the transfer from the receiver to the HyperLiquid L1 contract to credit the receiver on the L1
        _transfer(_receiver, HL_NATIVE_TRANSFER, _amountLD);
        emit HyperLiquidL1Transfer(_receiver, _amountLD);
    }
```

This permissioned function lets us access the internal function `_transfer` to transfer tokens to the L1 spot address with the `from` address as the `token receiver` address.

This emits the `Transfer` event that Hyperliquid L1 nodes/relayers listen to in order to credit the `receiver` address on the L1.
