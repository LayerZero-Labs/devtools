/**
 * @notice From OpenZeppelin:

 * @dev Implementation of the ERC-4626 "Tokenized Vault Standard" as defined in
 * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626[ERC-4626].
 *
 * This extension allows the minting and burning of "shares" (represented using the ERC-20 inheritance) in exchange for
 * underlying "assets" through standardized {deposit}, {mint}, {redeem} and {burn} workflows. This contract extends
 * the ERC-20 standard. Any additional extensions included along it would affect the "shares" token represented by this
 * contract and not the "assets" token which is an independent contract.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * In empty (or nearly empty) ERC-4626 vaults, deposits are at high risk of being stolen through frontrunning
 * with a "donation" to the vault that inflates the price of a share. This is variously known as a donation or inflation
 * attack and is essentially a problem of slippage. Vault deployers can protect against this attack by making an initial
 * deposit of a non-trivial amount of the asset, such that price manipulation becomes infeasible. Withdrawals may
 * similarly be affected by slippage. Users can protect against this attack as well as unexpected slippage in general by
 * verifying the amount received is as expected, using a wrapper that performs these checks such as
 * https://github.com/fei-protocol/ERC4626#erc4626router-and-base[ERC4626Router].
 *
 * Since v4.9, this implementation introduces configurable virtual assets and shares to help developers mitigate that risk.
 * The `_decimalsOffset()` corresponds to an offset in the decimal representation between the underlying asset's decimals
 * and the vault decimals. This offset also determines the rate of virtual shares to virtual assets in the vault, which
 * itself determines the initial exchange rate. While not fully preventing the attack, analysis shows that the default
 * offset (0) makes it non-profitable even if an attacker is able to capture value from multiple user deposits, as a result
 * of the value being captured by the virtual shares (out of the attacker's donation) matching the attacker's expected gains.
 * With a larger offset, the attack becomes orders of magnitude more expensive than it is profitable. More details about the
 * underlying math can be found xref:erc4626.adoc#inflation-attack[here].
 *
 * The drawback of this approach is that the virtual shares do capture (a very small) part of the value being accrued
 * to the vault. Also, if the vault experiences losses, the users try to exit the vault, the virtual shares and assets
 * will cause the first user to exit to experience reduced losses in detriment to the last users that will experience
 * bigger losses. Developers willing to revert back to the pre-v4.9 behavior just need to override the
 * `_convertToShares` and `_convertToAssets` functions.
 *
