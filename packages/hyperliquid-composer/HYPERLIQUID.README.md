# Hyperliquid Composer Implementation

We first start this document by talking about Hyperliquid, its quirks and the changes we had to make to achieve an `X-network` -> `HyperCore` oft transfer.

## Hyperliquid Networks

Hyperliquid has 2 “chains” - an `EVM` named `HyperEVM` and a `L1` called `HyperCore`.

HyperCore, or Core, is a high-performance Layer 1 which manages the Hyperliquid exchange’s on-chain perpetual futures and spot order books with one-block finality. ​

HyperEVM, or EVM, is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible environment that allows developers to build decentralized applications (dApps).

The `EVM` has precompiles that let you interact with `HyperCore`. The `HyperCore` is where the spot and perp trading happens (and is probably why you are interested in going to Hyperliquid and reading this doc. If you are not listing on HyperCore then HyperEVM is your almost standard EVM network - you just need to switch block sizes).

You can interact with `HyperEVM` via traditional `eth_` rpc calls - full list [here](https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/evm/json-rpc).

`HyperCore` however takes in a domain specific calls named `L1 actions` or `actions` - full list [here](https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/exchange-endpoint).

Note: archival nodes are NOT available on `HyperEVM`.

`HyperEVM` and `HyperCore` have their own block explorers. A list of explorers is [here](https://hyperliquid-co.gitbook.io/community-docs/community-and-projects/ecosystem-projects/tools). I personally use hypurrscan for `HyperCore` - <https://testnet.hypurrscan.io/> and for `HyperEVM` I use purrsec - <https://testnet.purrsec.com/>.

### Hyperliquid API

Hyperliquid supports several API functions that users can use on HyperCore to query information, following is an example.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz/info \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "spotMeta"}'
```

This will give you the spot meta data for HyperCore. (this is an example)

```json
{
  "universe": [
    {
      "name": "ALICE",
      "szDecimals": 0,
      "weiDecimals": 6,
      "index": 1231,
      "tokenId": "0x503e1e612424896ec6e7a02c7350c963",
      "isCanonical": false,
      "evmContract": null,
      "fullName": null,
      "deployerTradingFeeShare": "1.0"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `tokenId` is the address of the token on HyperCore.
The `evmContract` is the address of the `ERC20` token on HyperEVM.
The `deployerTradingFeeShare` is the fee share for the deployer of the token.

### HyperCore Actions

An action as defined by Hyperliquid is a transaction that is sent to the `HyperCore` - as it updates state on the `HyperCore` it needs to be a signed transaction from the wallet of the action sender.

You need to use `ethers-v6` to sign actions - <https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/providers/#Signer-signTypedData>

```bash
# add ethers-v6 to your project as an alias for ethers@^6.13.5
pnpm add ethers-v6@npm:ethers@^6.13.5
```

```ts
import { Wallet } from "ethers"; // ethers-v5 wallet
import { Wallet as ethersV6Wallet } from "ethers-v6"; // ethers-v6 wallet

const signerv6 = new ethersV6Wallet(wallet.privateKey); // where wallet is an ethers.Wallet from ethers-v5
const signature = await signerv6.signTypedData(domain, types, message);
```

This is because in ethers-v5 EIP-712 signing is not stable. - <https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/signer/#Signer-signTypedData>

> Experimental feature (this method name will change)
> This is still an experimental feature. If using it, please specify the exact version of ethers you are using (e.g. spcify "5.0.18", not "^5.0.18") as the method name will be renamed from \_signTypedData to signTypedData once it has been used in the field a bit.

You can use the official `Hyperliquid Python SDK` linked [here](https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk) to interact with HyperCore. We also built an in-house minimal typescript SDK that focuses on switching blocks, deploying the HyperCore token, and connecting the HyperCore token to a HyperEVM ERC20 (oft).

## Accounts

You can use the same account on `HyperEVM` and `HyperCore`, this is because `HyperCore` uses signed ethereum transactions to validate payload data.

## Multi Block Architecture

Since `HyperEVM` and `HyperCore` are seperate entities they have their own blocks. `Hyperliquid` interleaves the EVM and Core blocks in order of which they are created.

`HyperEVM` has 2 blocks - "small blocks" that are designed for increased throughput and therefore have a quick block time and have a lower max gas limit - 2 seconds and 2M gas (this is the default) - these blocks are meant for transactions that update state and not really for deploying. While you can deploy contracts that consume lower than 2M gas (out OFTs are larger than 2M) you would need "big blocks" that are allow for a larger max gas (30M gas) at the tradeoff of there only being 1 block per minute. Every "big blocks" only has 1 transaction.

They are both EVM blocks and you can toggle between them by sending an L1 action of type `evmUserModify` which is what [this block toggler does](https://hyperevm-block-toggle.vercel.app/)

```json
{ "type": "evmUserModify", "usingBigBlocks": true }
```

You can also use `bigBlockGasPrice` instead of `gasPrice` in your transactions.

> ⚠️ Note: This flags the user as using big blocks and all subsequent transactions on HyperEVM will be of type big block. You can also toggle this flag on and off.

`HyperCore` has its own blocks which results in 3 blocks. As Core and EVM blocks are produced at differing speeds with HyperCore creating more than HyperEVM the blocks created are not `[EVM]-[Core]-[EVM]` but rather something like:

```txt
[Core]-[Core]-[EVM-small]-[Core]-[Core]-[EVM-small]-[Core]-[EVM-large]-[Core]-[EVM-small]
```

## Precompiles

There are 2 ways in which Hyperliquid uses precompiles - "System Contracts" and "L1ActionPrecompiles"

The system contracts are:

- `0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222` is the system contract address for the `HYPE` token
- `0x200000000000000000000000000000000000abcd` is the system contract address for a created Core Spot token

and `L1ActionPrecompiles`

- `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` is one of the many `L1Read` precompiles.
- `0x3333333333333333333333333333333333333333` is the `L1WritePrecompile` and is used to send transactions to HyperCore.

More `L1ActionPrecompiles` found [here](https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/hyperevm/interacting-with-hypercore).

`L1Read` reads from the last produced `HyperCore` block at the time of EVM-transaction execution. Similarly `L1Write` writes to the first produced `HyperCore` block after the production of the EVM-block.

Note: the `L1Read` and `L1Write` precompiles are enabled only on Testnet. We have no timeline from the Hyperliquid team regarding a mainnet launch, although they have updated their mainnet node to support them.

## Token Standards

Tokens on the `EVM` are `ERC20` (EVM Spot) and on `HyperCore` are `HIP-1` (Core Spot).

Projects willing to buy a Core Spot need to undergo a 31 hour dutch auction to secure a core spot index after which they need to deploy the core spot - setting its configuration, genesis balances, token information, etc.

Note: if you use the [Hyperliquid UI](https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/deploySpot) you are forced to use an optional Hyperliquid token bootstrap thing called "Hyperliquidity". This is not supported by LayerZero because it ends up in a state where the asset bridge address can not be collaterized. More on this later in the document.

You can avoid this by using their API to deploy the core spot - we built an SDK <https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/devtools/pull/1441> which lets you use scripts (listed in the PR description) to set trading fee share, trigger user genesis, token genesis, and register a trading spot with USDC.

The Core Spot then needs to be connected to the EVM Spot (ERC20) - which is an irreversible process - described [here](https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/hyperevm/hypercore-less-than-greater-than-hyperevm-transfers#linking-Core-and-evm-spot-assets), we also have a SDK that lets you do this <https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/devtools/pull/1432>

If you do not link the `EVM spot` and `Core spot` then no `asset bridge` is formed and users cannot bridge the tokens between `HyperEVM` and `HyperCore` (bi-directional).

In order to connect the two assets and create the asset bridge there are 2 actions that need to be performed:

1. `requestEvmContract` - initiated by the HyperCore deployer and populates the intention to link the HIP-1 to the ERC20.
2. `finalizeEvmContract` - intiated by the HyperEVM deployer when an `EOA` sends the transactions to confirm the link.

This creates the asset bridge precompile `0x2000...abcd` (where `abcd` is the `coreIndexId` of the HIP-1 in hex) to send tokens between HyperEVM and HyperCore.

## The Asset Bridge

Transactions can be sent to the asset bridge address `0x2000...abcd` (where `abcd` is the `coreIndexId` of the HIP-1 in hex) to send tokens between HyperEVM and HyperCore.

The asset bridge address is computed by `0x2000000000000000000000000000000000000000` + the `coreIndexId` of the HIP-1 (in hex) - you can checkout `HyperLiquidComposerCodec.into_assetBridgeAddress()` in the `HyperLiquidComposer` contract to see how this is done - code found [here](contracts/library/HyperLiquidComposerCodec.sol).

HyperCore to HyperEVM is done via the action `spotSend`, or via the front end, with the destination address being the asset bridge address.

This bridge is crucial to the interop between `HyperEVM` and `HyperCore` and it behaves like a lockbox - unlocking tokens on the other side of the bridge where tokens are unlocked.

> ⚠️ Note : There are no checks in the system that checks asset bridge values before trying to transfer between `HyperCore` and `HyperEVM`.

Since this bridge behaves like a lockbox, this means that the other side of the bridge must always have enough tokens as defined in the transaction at the other end so that tokens can be passed. For tokens to be sent into `HyperCore` the contract deployer needs to mint the maximum supply (`u64.max` via the API which isn't the same as the UI due to `Hyperliquidity`) to either the token's asset bridge address or to their deployer account and later transfer it to the asset bridge address. The following invariant should hold at all times `(assetBridgeBalance.hypercore >= assetBridgeBalance.hyperevm when scaled`)

The asset bridge address is denoted as `[EVM | Core]`

This causes a transition in the bridge balances `[0 | 0]` -> `[0 | X]`.
Now users can send across the equivalent tokens that consumes `X` on `HyperCore` - let us assume that the decimal difference between EVM and Core is 10 => 1e10 EVM = 1 Core

This means that `X*1e10` tokens can be sent into the bridge on the EVM side and this would consume all `X` tokens on `HyperCore`

`[0 | X] --EVM(X*1e10)-> [X*1e10 | 0]`

It should be noted that any more tokens sent to the EVM bridge will remain in the asset bridge address and not transfer any tokens on `HyperCore` (the same applies for `HyperCore` -> `HyperEVM`) due to Hyperliquid NOT having ANY checks and the tokens will be locked in the asset bridge address FOREVER. The Composer contract has checks in place that refunds the `receivers` address on `HyperEVM` should it encounter a case of bridge consumption.

This is also why you can't "partially fund" the HyperCore system address. If you mint tokens to an address you control and fund HyperCore's asset bridge address with a subset of it `[0 | X.Core]`, these tokens would be consumed by users locking in their HyperEVM tokens to obtain HyperCore tokens, and now lets say that all `X` tokens on HyperCore have been consumed and you end in a state `[X.EVM | 0]`. You then fund it with `X.Core` more tokens hoping to make it `[X.EVM | X.Core]` -- except you can't do this as it will cause a withdraw on the `X.EVM`resulting in `[0 | X.Core]` with `X.Core` more tokens in circulation on HyperCore that can't be withdrawn.

Homework to the reader:

1. Based on the above understanding of the asset bridge address can you figure out why `Hyperliquidity` breaks the bridge? (hint: it messes with collaterization)
2. If you engage with partial funding and let's say you start with 100 Core tokens at your deployer address and you have intiated the bridge with:
   a) 30 Core tokens
   b) 70 Core tokens
   And these initial tokens are consumed by the users on HyperEVM. Is there a way you can fund the bridge on HyperCore with your remaining tokens?
   (hint 1: only one of them can)
   (hint 2: try failing the transaction on purpose)

## HyperEVM <> HyperCore Communication

HyperEVM can read state from HyperCore via `precompiles` - such as perps positions.
HyperEVM can send state to HyperCore through `events` at certain `precompile` addresses AND by transferring tokens through the asset bridge address.

## Transfers

Spot assets can be sent from HyperEVM to HyperCore and vice versa. They are called `Core Spot` and `EVM Spot`.
These are done by sending an `ERC20::transfer` with asset bridge address as the recipient.

The event emitted is `Transfer(address from, address to, uint256 value)` => `Transfer(_from, assetBridgeAddress, value);`
And this is picked up by the Hyperliquid team running the backend. (we do not have move information about this it is closed source and owned by the Hyperliquid team)

Note: The transaction MUST be sent to the `assetBridgeAddress`. Transfers to any other address is an address-address transfer within HyperEVM/HyperCore. For a cross-chain transfer you need to to:

1. Send the tokens to the asset bridge address to get the token on the other Hyperliquid network.
2. Send an transaction/action to transfer from your address to the receiver address on the other Hyperliquid network.

This is what we do in the `HyperliquidComposer` contract found - [here](contracts/HyperLiquidComposer.sol).

## Hyperliquid Composer

We can't auto convert all tokens to `native spot` in an `lzReceive` function because users might want to hold the token on `HyperEVM` and only move it to `HyperCore` when they want to trade.

The solution is to have an `lzCompose` function for the `EVM Spot` and `Core Spot` conversion on the ingress.
Unfortunately this means that `OFT` developers who already have an `lzCompose` function will need to do some plumbing - like chaining this `lzCompose` function to their current composer.

`_composeMsg` which is part of the `OFTComposeMsgCodec` (`SendParam.composeMsg`) should contain the `_receiver` address - and it should be encoded via `abi.encodePacked()` or `abi.encode()` of the `receiver` address.
This is because the `to` address in the transfer is the `Composer` contract address and not the `receiver` address.
The `Composer` contract receives the token during the `lzReceive` mint. It then executes `transfer` at the underlying oft's erc20 with the token amount minted in `lzReceive` and the destination address as the asset bridge address corresponding to the token the composer is connected with.

That particular `Transfer` event is what Hyperliquid L1 nodes/relayers listen to in order to credit the `receiver` address on the L1.

```solidity
struct SendParam {
  uint32 dstEid;
  bytes32 to; // OFT address (so that the OFT can execute the `compose` call)
  uint256 amountLD;
  uint256 minAmountLD;
  bytes extraOptions;
  bytes composeMsg; // token receiver address (msg.sender if you want your address to receive the token)
  bytes oftCmd;
}
```

Now that the token is with the `Composer` on HyperCore it then performs a `L1WritePrecompile` transaction to `0x33...333` (the `L1WritePrecompile` address) telling it to perform a `spot transfer` of the tokens from it's address to the `receiver`.

It must be noted that due to the token decimal difference between the `EVM::ERC20` and `HyperCore::HIP1` the tokens you see on `HyperCore` would be different with the wei decimal different (`HIP1.decimals()` - `ERC20.decimals()` in range `[-2,18]`). But when converting them back from `HyperCore` to `HyperEVM` the token decimals gets restored.

The composer will be a separate contract because we don't want developers to change their OFT contract.

```solidity
contract HyperLiquidComposer is IHyperLiquidComposer {
   constructor(
        address _endpoint,
        address _oft,
        uint64 _coreIndexId,
        uint64 _weiDiff
    ) {...}

    function lzCompose(address _oApp, bytes32 _guid, bytes calldata _message, address _executor, bytes calldata _extraData) external payable override {
        //
    }
}
```

## OFTWrapper for Hyperbridge

Using `Hyperbridge` incurrs a `5bp` fee. We use Stargate's [OFT Wrapper](https://github.com/stargate-protocol/stargate-v2/blob/main/packages/stg-evm-v2/src/peripheral/oft-wrapper/OFTWrapper.sol) on ALL networks that we support on `Hyperbridge`. The repository that we use to deploy the bridge on various networks can be found [here](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/hyperliquid-oft-wrapper)

## LayerZero Transaction on HyperEVM

Since this is a compose call - the `toAddress` is the `HyperLiquidComposer` contract address.
The token receiver is encoded as an `abi.encode/Packed()` of the `receiver` address into `SendParam.composeMsg`. This is later used in the `lzCompose` phase to transfer the tokens to the L1 spot address on behalf of the `token receiver` address.

```solidity
_credit(toAddress, _toLD(_message.amountSD()), _origin.srcEid)
```

which `mints` the amount in local decimals to the token receiver (`HyperLiquidComposer` contract address).

We now need to create a `Transfer` event to send the tokens from HyperEVM to HyperCore, the composer computes the amount receivable on `HyerCore` based on the number of tokens in HyperCore's asset bridge, the max transferable tokens (`u64.max * scale`) and sends the tokens to itself on HyperCore (this scales the tokens based on `HyperAsset.decimalDiff`). It also sends to the `receivers` address on HyperEVM any leftover tokens from the above transformation from HyperEVM amount to HyperCore.

```solidity
IHyperAssetAmount amounts = quoteHyperCoreAmount(_amount, isOft);
oft::transfer(0x2000...abcd, amounts.evm); // <- gets the user amounts.core on HyperCore
oft::transfer(_receiver_, amounts.dust);
```

As a result the invariant of `amounts.dust + amounts.evm = _amount` and `amounts.evm = 10.pow(decimalDiff) * amounts.core` are always satisfied.

```solidity
function _sendAssetToHyperCore(
  address _receiver,
  uint256 _amountLD
) internal virtual {
  IHyperAssetAmount memory amounts = quoteHyperCoreAmount(_amountLD, true);

  if (amounts.evm > 0) {
    token.safeTransfer(oftAsset.assetBridgeAddress, amounts.evm);
    IHyperLiquidWritePrecompile(HLP_PRECOMPILE_WRITE).sendSpot(
      _receiver,
      oftAsset.coreIndexId,
      amounts.core
    );
  }
  if (amounts.dust > 0) {
    token.safeTransfer(_receiver, amounts.dust);
  }
}
```

Since the composer also supports sending native token `$HYPE` into `HyperCore` the above function also has a native function variant in the composer that can be triggered by sending `msg.value` along with the compose payload.

## Deploy and Connect your OFT Guide

### Make changes to the underlying OFT (if you want to)

The current architecture has certain error handling AND checks (because Hyperliquid does not have any) to prevent tokens from locking up in the contract or at the asset bridge address, and you can change any of these behaviors.

#### Transfer exceeding u64.max

HyperCore's spot send only allows for a maximum of `u64` tokens to be transferred across. This means (in the unlikely event) that the user sends across greater than `u64` the difference would be returned the the `receiver` address on `HyperEVM`.

#### Transfer exceeding HyperCore Bridge Capactiy

HyperCore's Core Spots support a maximum of `u64` tokens on the Core Spot, and this is scaled by the decimal difference between the Core Spot and the EVM Spot. It is thus possible that the asset bridge on HyperCore has been consumed to the point where the entire transfer can't be sent over. In this event we split the `amount` capping it by `amount * 10.pow(ERC20.decimals() - HyperCore.decimals())` which is the maximum possible Core Spot tokens that can be consumed at the bridge at any given instant and compute the difference between the computed max Core amount converted to EVM amount (unscaling) and removing that from the incoming EVM amount. We now have `dust` which is the difference between the two and return this to the `receiver` address.

#### Malformed `composeMsg` - unable to abi.decode(composeMsg) into address

The above cases only occur in the stae when the compose payload is valid. In the event that developers write their own front end or try to interact with the composer with their own encoding and aren't careful it is possible that the message contains a `composeMsg` that can not be decoded to an `address`, as such we do not have the `receiver` address. In this event we try returning the tokens to the `sender` on HyperEVM where the sender is the `msg.sender` of the LayerZero tx on the source chain.

#### Malformed `composeMsg` - unable to abi.decode(composeMsg) into address and non-EVM sender

> ⚠️ Note: The only case when tokens can be locked in the Composer

Building on the afore mentioned case, it is possible that the compose transaction comes from `Solana` or a `move` language network that uses a different system of addresses. As such we can't return funds to that address on `HyperEVM` - in an ideal world we can have a composer that returns tokens to the sending network but that would consume more gas (doubling the transaction) and since gas paid is non refundable it would simply be wasted.

### Deploy your OFTs

The [oft deploy script](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/devtools/blob/feat/oft-hyperliquid-no-hop/examples/oft-hyperliquid/deploy/MyHyperliquidOFT.ts) is configured with a `hardhat-deploy` tag `MyHyperLiquidOFT`, this is renameable.

Since deploying contracts on HyperEVM needs big blocks, we need to submit an `L1Action`, the deploy script does this when the chainId matches those of HyperEVM testnet (998) or mainnet (999). Since this `action` is sent to `HyperCore` it requires an active `HyperCore` account - which you can do by funding the account with $1 of `HYPE` or `USDC` on `HyperCore`. If you do not do this you will get an error similar to:

```bash
L1 error: User or API Wallet <public key> does not exist.
```

Now wire your contracts:

`npx hardhat lz:deploy --tags MyHyperLiquidOFT`

## Wire your contracts

Wire the OFTs together with the standard layerzero wire command (or any other way you prefer doing it)

```bash
npx hardhat lz:oapp:wire --oapp-config <layerzero.config.ts>
```

Test the OFTs qith `quoteSend()` or by sending a test lzTransaction across the networks.

## Deploy the Core Spot

Open <https://app.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz/deploySpot> in a tab so that you can monitor the difference in steps. Or you can use:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz/info" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "type": "spotDeployState",
       "user": "<YOUR_ADDRESS>"
     }'
```

This will return a json object with the current state of the spot deployment.
(building a SDK wrapper around this is on our roadmap)

### Step 1/6 `Purchase the ticker`

You will have to buy a ticker from the Hyperliquid UI - <https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/deploySpot>

> ⚠️ note: Unless you buy the ticker you will not be able to deploy the Core Spot.

After this we can use the `core-spot create` command to create a new file under `./deployments/hypercore-{testnet | mainnet}` with the name of the Core Spot token index. This is not a Hyperliquid step but rather something to make the deployment process easier. It is crucial to the functioning of the token deployment after which it really is not needed.

```bash
npx @layerzerolabs/hyperliquid-composer core-spot \
    --action create \
    [--oapp-config <layerzero.config.ts>] \
    --token-index <coreIndex> \
    --network {testnet | mainnet} \
    [--log-level {info | verbose}]
```

### Step 2/6 `userGenesis`

This is the part where you set the genesis balances for the deployer and the users. Since `HyperCore` tokens are of uint type `u64` the most tokens possible are `18446744073709551615`.

You will have to edit the deployment created by `core-spot create` command that is under `./deployments/hypercore-{testnet | mainnet}` with the name of the Core Spot token index. It should be populated with the `deployer` and `asset bridge address` with both set to `0 wei`.

You can then use the `user-genesis` command to set the genesis balances for the deployer and the users.

If you aren't using `existingTokenAndWei` or `userAndWei` you will need to remove the contents of it making it:
Example:

```json
"existingTokenAndWei": [
    {
        "token": 0,
        "wei": ""
    }
],
```

into

```json
"existingTokenAndWei": []
```

Otherwise you run into the error:

```bash
Error deploying spot: missing token max_supply
```

```bash
npx @layerzerolabs/hyperliquid-composer user-genesis \
    --token-index <coreIndex> \
    [--action  {* | userAndWei | existingTokenAndWei | blacklistUsers}]
    --network {testnet | mainnet} \
    --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY_HYPERLIQUID \
    [--log-level {info | verbose}]
```

> ⚠️ Note: There is no limit to the number of time you can re-run this command.

### Step 3/6 `genesis`

This is the step that registers the above genesis balances on `HyperCore`.

> ⚠️ Note: This is irreversible.

```bash
npx @layerzerolabs/hyperliquid-composer set-genesis \
    --token-index <coreIndex> \
    --network {testnet | mainnet} \
    --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY_HYPERLIQUID \
    [--log-level {info | verbose}]
```

### Step 4/6 `registerSpot`

This is the step that registers the Core Spot on `HyperCore` and creates a base-quote pair against `USDC`, which is the only supported quote token as of now.

```bash
npx @layerzerolabs/hyperliquid-composer register-spot \
    --token-index <CoreIndex> \
    --network {testnet | mainnet} \
    --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY_HYPERLIQUID \
    [--log-level {info | verbose}]
```

Your Core Spot (that does not use Hyperliquidity) has now been deployed and registered on `HyperCore`.
The following command will return a json object with your newly deployed Core Spot token details.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.hyperliquid.xyz/info" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{ "type": "tokenDetails", "tokenId": "<YOUR_TOKEN_ID>"}'
```

> ⚠️ Note: The next 2 commands can be executed at a later time. It is possible to go directly to the token linking step.

### Step 5/6 `createSpotDeployment`

This is the step that creates a spot deployment without hyperliquidity. This step is meant for tokens deployed with Hyperliquidity but is also required for tokens deployed without Hyperliquidity to be listed on Spot trading, as such the values for `startPx` and `orderSz` are not required as they are set by the market and the value set does not matter. The value for `nOrders` however MUST be 0 as we do not support Hyperliquidity - <https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-python-sdk/blob/master/examples/spot_deploy.py#L97-L104>

You will NOT be prompted for the following and instead the values will be set to 0:

- startPx - The starting price. (1)
- orderSz - The size of each order (float, not wei) (0)
- nOrders - The number of orders the deployer wishes to seed with usdc instead of tokens. (0)
- nSeededLevels - The number of levels the deployer wishes to seed with usdc instead of tokens. (0)

> ⚠️ Note: This step can be executed after deployment

```bash
npx @layerzerolabs/hyperliquid-composer create-spot-deployment \
    --token-index <coreIndex> \
    --network {testnet | mainnet} \
    --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY_HYPERLIQUID \
    [--log-level {info | verbose}]
```

> ⚠️ Note: `spot-deploy-state` should fail after completing this step.

### Step 6/6 `setDeployerTradingFeeShare`

This is the step where you set the trading fee share for the deployer. It can be in the range of `[0%,100%]`.

A deployer fee share <https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/trading/fees> is claimed per transaction on HyperCore. Half of the base rate (50%) is allocated as the deployer fee share. The deployer can choose to forgo this fee share by setting the share to `0%`. This causes the deployer's fee share part to be burnt. If it were to be set to `100%`, the deployer would receive the full fee share part of the fee.

> ⚠️ Note: The trading fee can be reset as long as the new share is lower than the previous share.
> ⚠️ Note: This step can also be run after the core spot is deployed.

```bash
npx @layerzerolabs/hyperliquid-composer trading-fee \
    --token-index <coreIndex> \
    --share <[0%,100%]> \
    --network {testnet | mainnet} \
    --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY_HYPERLIQUID \
    [--log-level {info | verbose}]
```

## Connect the OFT to the deployed Core Spot

If you have run the above steps then you can use `--oapp-config` in the following commands. If not do not worry! Our SDK will prompt you for the OFT address and the OFT deployed transaction hash (we need the deployment nonce).

In order to enable transfers between the OFT and the Core Spot, we need to connect the OFT to the Core Spot. This is done in two steps:

### Step 1/2 `requestEvmContract`

This step is issued by the Core Spot deployer and populates in `HyperCore` that a request has been made for the mentioned Core Spot to be connected to the ERC20 deployed at the mentioned ERC20 address.

> ⚠️ Note: This step can be issued multiple times until the `finalizeEvmContract` step is issued.

```bash
npx @layerzerolabs/hyperliquid-composer request-evm-contract  \
    [--oapp-config <layerzero.config.ts>] \
    --token-index <coreIndex> \
    --network {testnet | mainnet} \
    --log-level verbose \
    --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY_HYPERLIQUID
```

### Step 2/2 `finalizeEvmContract`

This step completes the connection between the OFT and the Core Spot. It pulls either HyperEVM testnet or mainnet address from the LayerZero config file based on the `eid` and the Core Spot information from the HyperCore deployment.

> ⚠️ Note: This step is the final step and can only be issued once.

```bash
npx @layerzerolabs/hyperliquid-composer finalize-evm-contract  \
    [--oapp-config <layerzero.config.ts>] \
    --token-index <coreIndex> \
    --network {testnet | mainnet} \
    --log-level verbose \
    --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY_HYPERLIQUID
```

## Deploy the Composer

While the composer could have been deployed at any point in time due to its statelessness, it is technically the final step of the deployment process. The following script automatically handles the block switching for you.

```bash
npx hardhat lz:deploy --tags MyHyperLiquidComposer
```

> ⚠️ Note: You would need to fund the composer's address with HyperCore with at least $1 in USDC or HYPE so that it can perform L1WriteActions through it's address.

## Sending tokens from x-network to HyperEVM/Core

After populating your `.env` you can run the following script to send tokens across. Having the second argument `gas > 0` will send the tokens into `HyperCore`. Setting the third argument `value > 0` will also fund the user's address with `HYPE` tokens on `HyperCore`.

```bash
forge script script/SendScript.s.sol --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --rpc-url $RPC_URL_BSC_TESTNET --sig "exec(uint256,uint128,uint128)" <oft-amount> <composer-gas> <composer-value> --broadcast
```
