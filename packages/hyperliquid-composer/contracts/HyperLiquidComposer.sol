/**
 * @title Hyperliquid Composer
 * @author LayerZero Labs (@shankars99)
 * @notice This contract is a composer that allows transfers of ERC20 and HYPE tokens to a target address on hypercore.
 * @dev This address needs to be "activated" on hypercore post deployment
 * @dev This contract does NOT refund dust to the receiver on HyperEVM because we do not expect any due to truncation of sharedDecimals.
            In the off-chance that you have dust you would have to implement dust refunds to the receiver in:
            `_transferERC20ToHyperCore` and `_transferNativeToHyperCore`
 * @dev Disclaimer: If your token's evm total supply exceeds your asset bridge's balance when scaled to EVM, it is possible that the 
            composer will not be able to send the tokens to the receiver address on hypercore due to bridge consumption. 
            Tokens would instead be returned to the sender address on HyperEVM.
