 * // In this made up case it will take the original amount and will add 2 for every failed attempt
 * const strategy: RetryStrategy<[money: number]> = (attempt, error, [previousMoney], [originalMoney]) => [originalMoney + attempt * 2]

 * // everything is permissible, update the amount on every other attempt
