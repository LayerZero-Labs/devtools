## Development

This package provides integration tests for `@layerzerolabs/export-deployments` executed within a containerized setup. These tests are dependent on two networks that are bootstrapped in the root `docker-compose.yaml` and will only run when executed within that environment.

Please see the root [`README.md`](../../README.md) for more information.
