      # This step uses the changesets CLI to bump the package versions and/or publish the unpublished packages
      #
      # How this works is:
      #
      # - If there are any changesets (markdown files in the .changeset directory),
      #   changesets CLI will bump the package versions according to the bumps specified in the markdown files.
      #
      # - A PR is created containing these version bumps and with the changeset markdowns deleted
      #
      # - Once this PR is merged, this workflow kicks in again and this time checks
      #   whether there is anything that needs to be published
