runs:
  using: "composite"
  steps:
    # Cache build artifacts from turbo
    #
    # This step will speed up workflow runs that don't touch the whole codebase
    # (or the ones that don't touch the codebase at all)

    # We build architecture specific caches for turbo builds as there can be differences in the build artifacts between architectures

        # The hierarchy of restoring the cache goes as follows:
        #
        # - First we try to match an existing cache from the same branch
        # - Then we try to match a cache from the target branch of this PR (if this is not a PR, this cache will never exist)
        # - Then we try to match a cache from the default branch
        # - Then we try to match any cache
