## Introduction

Welcome to the **LayerZero Developer Tools Hub**. This repository houses everything related to the LayerZero Developer Experience, including application contract standards, CLI examples, packages, scripting tools, and more. It serves as a central hub for developers to build, test, deploy, and interact with LayerZero-based omnichain applications (OApps).

Visit our <a href="https://docs.layerzero.network/" style="color: #a77dff">developer docs</a> to get started building omnichain applications.

## Repository Structure
The primary folders that smart contract developers will find most useful are:

`examples/`: Contains various example projects demonstrating how to build with `OApp.sol` (Omnichain App Standard), `OFT.sol` (Omnichain Fungible Tokens), `ONFT.sol` (Omnichain Non-Fungible Tokens), and more. These examples serve as templates and learning resources.

`packages/`: Includes a collection of NPM packages, libraries, and tools that facilitate interaction with LayerZero contracts. This includes deployment scripts, CLI tools, protocol devtools, and testing utilities.

### Examples

Here is a list of example projects available in the `examples/` directory:

```
$ ls examples
mint-burn-oft-adapter  oapp                 oft                   oft-solana            omnicounter-solana    onft721-zksync
native-oft-adapter     oapp-read            oft-adapter           oft-upgradeable       onft721               uniswap-read
```

### Packages

Here is a list of packages available in the `packages/` directory:

```
$ ls packages
