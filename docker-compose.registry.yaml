        # Now we publish the packages
        #
        # FIXME This will publish the packages under their current versions, not taking any changesets into account.
        # Taking changesets into account comes with a convoluted issue:
        #
        # Once changesets are applied, package.json files are updated. These changes are not propagated to the repository
        # from which the examples are being cloned though. So even though the packages will be updated & published,
        # examples contained in the repository will hold references to their old versions
        #
        # The solution is to serve these changes out of a local git repository - very much possible
        # with one blocker - tiged, an NPM package we use to clone the examples, can only work with github repositories
        # and does not support e.g. local git repositories as sources
